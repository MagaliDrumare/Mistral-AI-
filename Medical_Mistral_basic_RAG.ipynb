        "# Basic RAG\n",
        "Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is an AI framework that synergizes the capabilities of LLMs and information retrieval systems. It’s useful to answer questions or generate content leveraging external knowledge. There are two main steps in RAG: 1) retrieval: retrieve relevant information from a knowledge base with text embeddings stored in a vectore store; 2) generation: insert the relevant information to the prompt for the LLM to generate information. In this guide, we will walk through a very basic example of RAG with four implementations:\n",

        "#### Considerations:\n",
        "- **Chunk size**: Depending on your specific use case, it may be necessary to customize or experiment with different chunk sizes and chunk overlap to achieve optimal performance in RAG. For example, smaller chunks can be more beneficial in retrieval processes, as larger text chunks often contain filler text that can obscure the semantic representation. As such, using smaller text chunks in the retrieval process can enable the RAG system to identify and extract relevant information more effectively and accurately.  However, it’s worth considering the trade-offs that come with using smaller chunks, such as increasing processing time and computational resources.\n",
        "- **How to split**: While the simplest method is to split the text by character, there are other options depending on the use case and document structure. For example, to avoid exceeding token limits in API calls, it may be necessary to split the text by tokens. To maintain the cohesiveness of the chunks, it can be useful to split the text by sentences, paragraphs, or HTML headers. If working with code, it’s often recommended to split by meaningful code chunks for example using an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) parser.\n",

        "To create an embedding, use Mistral’s embeddings API endpoint and the embedding model `mistral-embed`. We create a `get_text_embedding` to get the embedding from a single text chunk and then we use list comprehension to get text embeddings for all text chunks.\n"

AlphaFold 3 introduces the \"Pairformer,\" a deep learning architecture inspired by the transformer, and uses a diffusion model to progress iteratively towards a 3D depiction of the molecular structure.

It introduces the \"Pairformer\", a deep learning architecture inspired by the transformer, and a diffusion model to progress towards a 3D depiction of the molecular structure. The AlphaFold server was created to provide free access to AlphaFold 3 for non-commercial research.\n"
